# Portfolio-CodingValley
This is a personal portfolio inspired by Stardew Valley! A game that I truly love to play during my spare time.
This is my very first personal project where I truly went for creativity and passion.

It is a project where I tried new things such as the animation for the falling petals etc.
All of the graphics that is seen (background images, sign, profile border) are all hand-made.
The languages that was used in this website are: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
